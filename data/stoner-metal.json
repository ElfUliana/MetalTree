            "Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, blues rock, acid rock, and doom metal. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \"stoner rock\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \"desert rock.\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \"retro\" production. The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep.\n\t",
            "Like most subgenres of music, the origins of stoner rock are hard to trace and pinpoint. Nevertheless, stoner rock has its known progenitors and signature songs that helped shape the genre. Blue Cheer is considered one of the pioneers of the style, as Allmusic author, Greg Prato, put it, \"When talks about 'stoner rock' come up, one band that tends to get overlooked is Blue Cheer.\" According to critic Mark Deming, the band's first album, Vincebus Eruptum, \"is a glorious celebration of rock & roll primitivism run through enough Marshall amps to deafen an army\"; not so far from the heaviness of MC5's Kick Out the Jams and the Velvet Underground's White Light\/White Heat.",
            "Rolling Stone claims, \"What stoner rock delivers, slowed down and magnified, is the riff, the persistent legacy of Mississippi blues. Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were the first to make a monolith of it.\" Sir Lord Baltimore have been called \"the godfathers of stoner rock\" and Leaf Hound have been cited for influencing countless bands in the stoner rock movement including Kyuss and Monster Magnet. Primevil's album Smokin' Bats at Campton's has been called a \"touchstone\" of stoner rock. Jim DeRogatis has said that stoner rock bands are \"reaching back for inspiration to the psychedelic, proto-metallic jamming of bands like Cream, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Hawkwind.\" According to DeRogatis, the roots of stoner rock can be heard on Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Hawkwind's 25 Years On 1973\u20131977 box set, the aforementioned Blue Cheer's album, Deep Purple's Machine Head and Blue \u00d6yster Cult's Workshop of the Telescopes. Black Sabbath's Master of Reality is often cited as the first album of the genre. Martin Popoff stated: \"When Sweet Leaf kicks in, one witnesses simultaneously the invention of stoner rock\"."
